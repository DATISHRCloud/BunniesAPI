# BunniesAPI
Cutest.  API.  Ever.

The Bunnies API models (what else?) bunnies!  It should be RESTful.

This API project is to demonstrate API documentation using Swagger (or more accurately, Swashbuckle) in ASP.NET Core.

Check it! https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

**Start:** Just your basic Web API project with no documentation. ｡･ﾟﾟ*(>д<)*ﾟﾟ･｡

**Step2:** Added Swagger and configured the Swagger UI.  No document customization yet...

**Step3:** Added some basic XML documentation to show how Swagger picks that up and puts it into the Swagger Doc. 

**Step4:** Even more Swagger doc customization through XML documentation.

**Step5:** UI customization through custom javascript and css injection.  Pretty!  \(★ω★)/
